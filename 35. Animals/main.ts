// Animals: Think of at least three different animals that have a common characteristic.
// Store the names of these animals in a list, and then use a for loop to print out the name of each animal.

// Modify your program to print a statement about each animal, such as A dog would make a great pet. 
// â€¢ Add a line at the end of your program stating what these animals have in common.
//  You could print a sentence such as Any of these animals would make a great pet!
let animals: string[] = ["Dog", "Cat", "Rabbit"];

// using For-Loop
for (let greatanimal of animals) {
    console.log(`A ${greatanimal} would you make a great pet.`);
}

// print a message outside of For-Loop

console.log("Any of these animals would make a great pet and make us Enjoyment!");
